# Node.js + React.js boilerplate
Trying to learn React, so I figured I'd make myself a starting point.

## How to use:
1. Fork/Clone this repo
2. run `npm install`, then `npm start` to run on port 3000

## Other non-React-specific additions
- Included Bootstrap and jQuery

##Considerations
This setup does *not* include any database. I will be working on a branch that uses React + Mongoose.
